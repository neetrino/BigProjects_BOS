## Initial Monorepo Layout

```text
apps/
  web/
  api/
packages/
  domain/
  contracts/
  db/
  ui/
  shared/
  config/
```

## Security Baseline

- strict validation at API boundaries;
- no secrets in code;
- argon2 if passwords are implemented;
- httpOnly secure sessions/cookies;
- rate limits for auth and provisioning endpoints;
- audit logs for important status/provisioning/checklist changes.

## Confirmation Needed Before Code

- final auth approach;
- database provider/account;
- file storage provider/account;
- email provider/account;
- staging/prod environments and domains.
