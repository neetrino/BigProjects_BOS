# BOS Integration Contracts

## Purpose

This file defines the first integration contracts between BigProjects BOS and ToonExpo Ecosystem.

## v1 Contract Principle

Do not duplicate ToonExpo data into BOS in v1.

BigProjects admins can open ToonExpo directly when they need ToonExpo data.

The main integration is account/company provisioning from BOS to ToonExpo.

## BOS -> ToonExpo Signals

### Approved Participant Signal

Fields:

- request id;
- company id from BOS;
- company name;
- company type: builder | bank | partner | service | other;
- contact person;
- contact email;
- contact phone optional;
- approved participant status;
- requested ToonExpo access modules.

### Create ToonExpo Account Request

Fields:

- request id;
- company id from BOS;
- company name;
- company type;
- primary contact name;
- primary contact email;
- primary contact phone optional;
- role/type: builder | partner | bank;
- event cycle id/name if relevant;
- modules to enable: builder_portal, constructor_crm, readiness, partner_profile, bank_offers, analytics.

## ToonExpo -> BOS Response

### Account Creation Result

Fields:

- request id;
- ToonExpo company id;
- primary user id;
- status: success | linked_existing | failed;
- error message if failed;
- created_at.

## Idempotency Rule

Provisioning must be safe to retry.

Use request id, BOS company id and primary contact email to avoid duplicate companies/users.

## Rule

Contracts start minimal. Do not build complex sync before the core modules exist.
